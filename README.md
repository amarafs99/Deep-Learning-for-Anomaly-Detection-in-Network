## üìä Dataset: UNSW-NB15
The **UNSW-NB15 dataset**, developed by the *Australian Centre for Cyber Security (ACCS)* at UNSW Canberra, represents modern network traffic containing both **normal and attack records**.

| **Property** | **Description** |
|---------------|----------------|
| Total Records | 2,540,044 |
| Training Set  | 175,341 |
| Test Set      | 82,332 |
| Total Features | 49 (numeric + categorical) |
| Attack Types  | 9 (e.g., Fuzzers, DoS, Exploits, Reconnaissance, etc.) |
| Label | Normal / Attack |

Each record includes packet-level and flow-level attributes such as duration, protocol type, service, source bytes, destination bytes, and connection state.

## üßÆ Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing pipeline ensures model-ready, clean, and normalized data.

### Steps:
1. **Handling Missing & Duplicate Data** ‚Äî Identifies and removes incomplete or duplicate records.  
2. **Skewness Reduction** ‚Äî Log transformation applied to skewed numeric columns.  
3. **Encoding** ‚Äî Label encoding for target; one-hot encoding for categorical attributes.  
4. **Standardization** ‚Äî Features normalized using z-score normalization for stable gradient flow.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Histograms**: Displayed the distribution of key features to detect skewness.  
- **Correlation Matrix**: Highlighted inter-feature relationships for feature selection.  
- **Skewness Plots**: Identified highly skewed numeric fields needing transformation.  

> *Note: EDA figures can be found in the Jupyter Notebook or project report.*

## üß† Model Architecture
A **fully connected ANN** was designed to learn non-linear relationships within network data.

| **Layer** | **Type** | **Units** | **Activation** | **Purpose** |
|------------|-----------|------------|----------------|-------------|
| Input | Dense | 49 | ReLU | Accepts normalized features |
| Hidden 1 | Dense | 128 | ReLU | Captures high-level patterns |
| Hidden 2 | Dense | 64 | ReLU | Reduces dimensionality and prevents overfitting |
| Hidden 3 | Dense | 32 | ReLU | Enhances abstraction |
| Output | Dense | 1 | Sigmoid | Outputs binary prediction (Normal/Attack) |

### üîß Hyperparameters
| **Parameter** | **Value** |
|----------------|-----------|

### ‚èπÔ∏è Early Stopping
- Monitors validation loss.
- Stops training if no improvement for 10 consecutive epochs.
- Prevents overfitting and reduces computation time.

### üìà Regularization
- Added **Dropout (0.3)** between dense layers.
- Prevents co-adaptation and improves generalization.
